        "# THEORY QUESTIONS\n",
        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)is a programming approach that uses sets of objects instead of logic-based methods. It stores data and related operations in the form of abstract data classes. These data classes are then used multiple times to generate new objects with the same functions.\n",
        "It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- Classes are simply blueprints for creating objects.It is a model or blueprint of an object that specifies all the properties of the objects. Classes have the data and its associated function wrap in it.\n",
        "The class defines the state and behaviours of an object. Before creating an object you know what the properties an object will contains based on the class.\n",
        "The beauty of classes is that they allow you to create objects that behave in a consistent and predictable way.\n",
        "A class has its own attributes, objects, and methods.\n",
        "> Attributes: What the class looks like\n",
        "> Methods: What the class does\n",
        "> Objects: What the class is.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, an object is a fundamental building block that represents a real-world entity or concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts in OOP that help in designing and structuring classes and objects effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Abstraction - It emphasizes the creation of clear and simplified interfaces that hide implementation details. It allows you to represent essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details. It focuses on defining a common structure that highlights what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Encapsulation- It emphasizes data hiding and controlled access to attributes and methods within a class. It is about packaging related data and behavior together and limiting external access to it. It restricts direct access to some components of an object and provides controlled access through methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder Methods, also known as magic methods. they use as special syntax to perform class-specific operations in Python.“dunder” is the short term used for “double underscores”.\n",
        "Dunder methods are special methods in Python that have names beginning and ending with double underscores (__). They’re automatically work by certain Python operations and built-in functions.\n",
        ">For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"_ _init_ _\" is called when an object is created\n",
        "\n",
        "- \" _ _str_ _\" defines how it is printed\n",
        "\n",
        "- \"_ _add_ _\" lets you use the '+' operator\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "- Inheritance is one of the core features of object-oriented programming. It is a programming procedure that allows you to reuse code by referencing the behaviors and data of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        ">BENEFITS:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Code reusablity\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Modularity\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Extensiblity\n",
        "\n",
        ">OOPS support six different types of inheritance:-\n",
        "- Single Inheritance\n",
        "- Multi-level Inheritance\n",
        "- Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "- Multipath Inheritance\n",
        "- Hierarchical Inheritance\n",
        "- Hybrid Inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or operation in their own unique way.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In Python polymorphism allows methods in different classes to share the same name but behave differently based on the object calling them. This makes code more flexible and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a powerful tool in Python, providing flexibility and extensibility to your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved primarily through:\n",
        "\n",
        ">1. Using Access Modifiers - Using naming conventions to indicate protected or private members like single underscore (\" _ _\") or double underscore (\"__ _\")\n",
        "\n",
        "example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self._name = \"John\"  # protected\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        ">2. Providing controlled access via getter and setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class MyClass:\n",
        "\n",
        "   def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.__name = \"harry\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    def get_name(self):\n",
        "        return self.__name\n",
        "\n",
        "    def set_name(self, name):\n",
        "        self.__name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        ">3. Using @property decorators for cleaner code.\n",
        "example:\n",
        "\n",
        " class MyClass:\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __init__(self):\n",
        "        self.__name = \"harry\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    @property\n",

        "        self.__name = value\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created. It allows you to set up the initial state of an object by assigning values to its attributes or performing any setup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        " The constructor method is named \"_ _init_ _\". It is automatically called when an object of a class is instantiated.In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Characteristics of Python Class Methods:\n",
        "  - Bound to the class, not the instance.\n",
        "  - Can access and modify class state.\n",
        "  - Defined with the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Characteristics of Python Static Methods:\n",
        "  - Not bound to the class or instance.\n",
        "  - Cannot access or modify class or instance state.\n",
        "  - Defined with the @staticmethod decorator.  \n",
        "  \n",
        "--- The difference between the Class method and the static method is:\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A class method takes cls as the first parameter while a static method needs no specific parameters.\n",
        "  - A class method can access or modify the class state while a static method can't access or modify it.\n",
        "  - In general, static methods know nothing about the class state. They are utility-type methods that take some parameters and work upon those parameters. On the other hand class methods must have class as a parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- In Object-Oriented Programming , method overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters. It's used to provide multiple behaviors under one method name based on arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding is a core concept in OOP that allows a child class (subclass) to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class (superclass).\n",
        "   - To customize or extend the behavior of a method from a base class.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   -  To support polymorphism: treating different objects in the same way but getting different behavior.\n",
        "  \n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The property decorator in Python is used to define a method as a property, so you can access it like an attribute—without calling it like a function.\n",
        "\n",
        ">To encapsulate instance variables.\n",
        "\n",
        ">To allow getter behavior with a method that looks like an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        ">To add controlled access to a class attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Key Reasons Polymorphism Is Important:\n",
        "  - It  Simplifies the code - We can write generalized code that works on objects of different types.\n",
        "  - It Supports Code Reuse - We don’t need to duplicate code for each subclass.\n",
        "  - It Enables Flexibility and Extensibility - We can add new classes (new \"forms\") without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is designed to be a blueprint for other classes. Abstract classes allow us to define methods that must be implemented by subclasses, ensuring a consistent interface while still allowing the subclasses to provide specific implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) include:-\n",
        "\n",

        "   h) Improved code structuring and organisation\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "    Class variables, also known as static variables. They are variables that are shared among all instances of a class. They are typically used to store data that is common to all instances of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    They are initialized only once, typically when the class is first loaded into memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "    They retain their value until the program terminates or the class is explicitly unloaded.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Instance Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "    Instance variables, also known as non-static variables, are variables that are unique to each instance of a class.\n",
        "    They are used to store data that is specific to each instance of a class.  \n",
        "    These variables are initialized when an instance of the class is created. Each instance has its own set of initial values for the instance variables. These values can be assigned during object creation or set through methods or constructors.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- When a class is derived from more than one base class, this types of inheritance is called multiple inheritance in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "    It allows a child class to inherit all the properties and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    In the multiple inheritance, there are two or more parent classes and one child class.   \n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of \"_ _str_ __\" and \"_repr_ _\" methods in Python?\n",
        "- Both are special methods in Python used to define how an object is represented as a string. They help make objects readable.  \n",
        " > _ _str_ _() –:\n",

        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?  \n",
        "- The super() function in Python is used to call methods from a parent (super) class.\n",
        "\n",
        "    It plays a key role in inheritance and method overriding, allowing you to reuse and extend functionality from a base class without hardcoding class names.\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__() method is a special method in Python known as a destructor.\n",
        "\n",
        "    It's called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when there are no more references to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "    If an object implements the _ _del_ _ method, Python calls the _ _del_ _ method right before the garbage collector destroys the object.\n",
